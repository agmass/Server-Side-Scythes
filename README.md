# Scythes

Adds in Scythes, a new weapon that increases attack reach by 2.6m instead of attack damage or speed.

**Also adds in the Cloud Scythe made of calcite**, a new type of scythe that gives the player holding it a Double Jump until they touch the ground.

# Resource Pack
- Install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) (you may already have it installed as a dependency)
- Follow [this guide](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) for up-to-date details on how to host your pack for your specific scenario.

- **Make sure to run** `/polymer generate-pack` and rejoin your server to see the textures properly.

# Obtaining

- The crafting recipes, listed in the `Recipes` Section
- `/give @s scythes:(name)`
- `/polymer creative` > Combat

# Balancing

Scythes are balanced to have less attack speed and damage than an axe, but having slightly more damage than a sword; and having higher reach for both

Scythes lose durability the same as swords, and the Cloud Scythe uses a bit of durability on double jump

## Bedrock / Geyser

Bedrock players playing through geyser will not be able to see the custom textures.

Bedrock players get 4 extra damage points due to the fact they do not have access to the extra reach attribute java has
