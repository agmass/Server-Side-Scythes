# Scythes

***This mod works completely on the server-side, meaning clients do not (and should not need to) install this into their modpacks!***

Adds in Scythes, a new weapon that increases attack reach by 2.6m instead of attack damage or speed.

**Also adds in the Cloud Scythe made of calcite**, a new type of scythe that gives the player holding it a Double Jump until they touch the ground.

This mod also allows other mods to make scythes, such as [BleedingEdge](https://github.com/agmass/BleedingEdge)

## Resource Pack
- Install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) (you may already have it installed as a dependency)
- Follow [this guide](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) for up-to-date details on how to host your pack for your specific scenario.

## Obtaining

- The crafting recipes, listed in the `Recipes` Section
- `/give @s scythes:(name)`
- `/polymer creative` > Combat

## Balancing

Scythes are balanced to have less attack speed and damage than an axe, but having slightly more damage than a sword; and having higher reach for both

Scythes lose durability the same as swords, and the Cloud Scythe uses a bit of durability on double jump

### Bedrock / Geyser

Bedrock players playing through geyser will not be able to see the custom textures.

Bedrock players get 4 extra damage points due to the fact they do not have access to the extra reach attribute java has
