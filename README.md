# Scythes

***This mod works completely on the server-side, meaning clients do not (and should not need to) install this into their modpacks!***

Adds in Scythes, a new weapon that increases attack reach by 2.6m instead of attack damage or speed.

**Also adds in many, MANY new scythes (after v2.0.0) all with custom abilities to shake up PVP!**
 
## Resource Pack
- Install [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) (you may already have it installed as a dependency)
- Follow [this guide](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/) for up-to-date details on how to host your pack for your specific scenario.

## Obtaining

- The crafting recipes, listed in the `Recipes` Section
- `/give @s scythes:(name)`
- `/polymer creative` > Combat

## Balancing

Scythes are balanced to have less attack speed and damage than an axe, but having slightly more damage than a sword; and having higher reach for both

Scythes lose durability the same as swords, and the Cloud Scythe uses a bit of durability on double jump

### Bedrock / Geyser

Bedrock players playing through geyser will not be able to see the custom textures.

Bedrock players get 4 extra damage points due to the fact they do not have access to the extra reach attribute java has

Bedrock players do not see effects of the growth scythe and are not able to see the border of the border scythe, however both (should) still work for Java players.
